                A clean house is organized for cleanliness: the dish towel lies near the sink, the shoe rack sits near the door, and the broom stays near the corridor in which dust collects. It was not always organized this way. The people living in the clean house have positioned the items to be as they are now, and the way in which they have organized their house reflects the way in which they maintain it.
                <br><br>
                But we? We live like slobs. The Earth as it is is a pigsty. Its tables are littered with trash, its sinks are clogged with rotting food, and its carpet is filthy with mud. The stench of defeat pervades the air and chokes life and hope from living breath. We as its inhabitants are not far from reflecting its sorry state.
                <br><br>
                Environmental responsibility is the act of cleaning up. The decency we owe towards the place we live and towards one another is nothing more than tidying our rooms and washing the dishes. Just as it is our obligation as roommates or housemates to take off our shoes when we enter the door and wash our hands before we eat, it is our obligation as human beings, co-residents of the Earth, to leave the land clean and the skies pure.
                <br><br>
                So, I say to you, my fellow co-residents, my fellow roommates - it is time for spring cleaning. These are but a few steps forward in our journey of tidying up.

                        As designers, we are not servants, but leaders which carry the heavy responsibility of shaping the future. Heavy is the head that wears the crown — and our heavy heads must decide the impact and examine the effect that our work will have.
                        <br><br>
                        We must strike. We must demand that the destruction stops here. We must refuse contracts with initiatives that would contribute to the pollution of minds and bodies: the spread of misinformation, the generation of toxic environmental waste. We must take responsibility for ourselves, our design, and the affiliations we develop. If you are not with the ethical future, you are against it.

                        Sustainability is not enough. We cannot carry on supporting the current structures we uphold. We must dream of something better, we must demand a changed world. 
                        <br><br>
                        But this change is not solely rooted in the future. No, to secure an ethical future we have to first stop the harm of the present and undo the harm of the past.

                        Expect change and then be the one to enact it. Choose leverage points carefully, and don’t be afraid to tackle larger challenges for more impact. It is the entire system and culture which needs to be challenged, not just the trickle-down effects of it.

                        Caring about the environment begins with caring about your own environment. While the value of international solidarity and radical thought beyond borders should never be understated, it is helpful to allow yourself to focus on improving your immediate surroundings.

                        Relatively, the individual has a much greater impact in a community than it does in the broader globe. Get involved with the people around you to make a difference in your community.

                        Do not focus on what you do not have, but instead what you currently possess. If you focus on your shortages, incapabilities, or barriers, the battle is lost before it is even begun. Play to your strengths and think creatively about how to utilize the resources you do possess.

                        Use critical thinking skills to evaluate the accounts you listen to. Understand that no opinion is unbiased, and there is no such single truth. Foster an independent voice, even when it may contradict those of your allies.

                        Design for mortality. Degradability is part of nature and nothing lasts forever. Allow your design to undo itself over time, so that it may serve future generations with its recycled and harvested materials rather than decline into a hazardous death.

                        Consider that the answer does not always involve new technologies and ideas, but sometimes that of many years past. Humans have existed for thousands of years, and ancient people and societies were as every bit as intelligent as we are today, if not moreso. Design with ancient solutions in mind.

                        We need to prepare for multiple outcomes. Use speculative design to design for different futures in both practical and imaginary ways. Don’t be afraid to dream of new technologies and abilities which may aid us in the future.

                        We know the most harmful practices to human life and the Earth’s wellbeing do not come from the person that litters once, but the person that manufactured the litter. We know it is the fault of corporate harm to the environment, exploitation of labor, and avoidance of taxes.
                        <br><br>
                        To solve the climate crisis, it is imperative that we hold the individuals behind these acts accountable for the harm they have and are in the process of causing. We must rethink our economic and political systems in the interests of investigating and prosecuting environmental and labor crimes.
