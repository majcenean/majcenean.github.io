                        As designers, we are not servants, but leaders which carry the heavy responsibility of shaping the future. Heavy is the head that wears the crown â€” and our heavy heads must decide the impact and examine the effect that our work will have.
                        <br><br>
                        We must strike. We must demand that the destruction stops here. We must refuse contracts with initiatives that would contribute to the pollution of minds and bodies: the spread of misinformation, the generation of toxic environmental waste. We must take responsibility for ourselves, our design, and the affiliations we develop. If you are not with the ethical future, you are against it.

                        Sustainability is not enough. We cannot carry on supporting the current structures we uphold. We must dream of something better, we must demand a changed world. 
                        <br><br>
                        But this change is not solely rooted in the future. No, to secure an ethical future we have to first stop the harm of the present and undo the harm of the past.
