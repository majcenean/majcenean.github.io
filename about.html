            <p>Maj is a graphic designer born, raised, and living in San Francisco, CA. They are a senior design major and classical studies minor at the University of San Francisco. They are proud to represent their Chinese-American heritage and nonbinary community.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic; text-transform: lowercase; padding-left: 20px;">
                I believe a just and ethical world is possible and art is a pathway to achieve it. We have the power to design a beautiful future.
                <br><br>
                Art is a human reflex; it transmits human knowledge, develops empathy, and allows us to connect to one another in ways not possible through speech and typical manners of communication; it is the communication of raw emotion. 
                <br><br>
                I believe in telling stories and narratives through artwork; stories have the power to change our world. I think deeply about what stories we surround ourselves with, recurring themes and messages.
                <br><br>
                Artwork can say what everyone is afraid to say. I use my artwork to express myself and critique systems that otherwise go unquestioned.
                <br><br>
                I care about what goes on in othersâ€™ minds. I want to create experiences. I want to change the way people think. I want to awe, to inspire, to induce contemplation.
